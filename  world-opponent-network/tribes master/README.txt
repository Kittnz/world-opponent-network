It was compiled using the latest and greatest Visual C++ 2008.
If you can't run it tell me. :)
This is released under the GPL.

I've updated it so it no longer reads motd.txt every time there is a query.
I've added the usage of keys to all query and reply packets.  Keys are random. :)

And a few little things here and there.

Have fun. - Kigen
